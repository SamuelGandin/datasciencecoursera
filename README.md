# datasciencecoursera
This is a repository created for the purposes of the second part of the final project of the Data Scientist Toolbox course.

Note to the markers:
When assessing my work, please keep in mind that I am a beginner at data science. I am fairly highly motivated though, and would even like to make a living by getting a job in this area.

Thank you for the time you will spend in assessing my work!

Regards,
Samuel
